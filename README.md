Cricket Data Analysis 🏏
Welcome to the Cricket Data Analysis project! This project is all about exploring and understanding cricket data. We’re going to look at player stats, match results, and lots of interesting facts from the world of cricket.

What’s Inside? 📁
Cricket Dataset: This is a collection of information on cricket matches, including scores, player details, and results.
Analysis: We use this data to find out who performed the best, what made teams win, and any trends that show up in matches over time.
Pandas AI: We’ve used Pandas AI to help analyze the data even smarter! It can quickly answer questions about the dataset and find insights, making it easier to understand cricket better.
Visuals: Graphs and charts help us see patterns in the data quickly and make our findings even more interesting!
